\chapter{Additional work}
\label{cha:additional}

Two proposed method for structure initialization has been proposed. However, a prior initialization for motion --rotation and translation matrices-- is required. This chapter deals with a different motion initialization, based on measurements and also on prior initialization.

This chapter is purely theoretical and more experiments most be performed. Nevertheless, it is worth further research. It will be assumed knowledge of linear algebra and epipolar geometric.


\section{Preliminary}

In this chapter, only stereo pair will be considered instead of a multi-cameras setup (see Figure \ref{...}).
