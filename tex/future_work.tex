\chapter{Future work}
\label{cha:future}

Since the ROS package describes in this thesis is still in development stage many things need to be improved, some points are listed here:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The highest priority is to fix triangulation in order to get a better structure initialization, this will lead to a considerable improvement in the whole calibration system.

%  \item Use another initialization for the $[R_i t_i]$... TODO...

 \item User interface is required to make the package more useful.

 \item The system should be robot agnostic. There is a wizard in the new Moveit! package that can be used it to create the configuration files.

 \item Export the URDF to a file. I had to fixed some bugs in the URDF Dom package, they will allow to create this functionality.

\end{itemize}
