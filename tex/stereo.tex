\chapter{Stereo recalibration}
\label{cha:stereo_recalibration}

This section is a short introduction of the notation and theory used for the rest of the thesis.

% It will be introduced in  the notation and the theory used for the rest of the thesis
% * but worked in the stereo and with synthetic data.
% * Proposed initializations
% * Method selection (triangulation because it is easy to extend for multi-view, and blahblah...).


\section{Theoretical background}
\label{sec:theoretical_background}

This section is a short introduction of the notation and theory used for the rest of the thesis.

\subsection{Pinhole camera model}

A 2D point is denoted by $\x = [x,y]^T$. A 3D point is denoted by $\X = [X,Y,Z]^T$. It is used $\x = [x,y,1]^T$ to denote the point in homogeneous coordinate (augmented vector by adding~$1$ as the last element) and $\X = [X,Y,Z,1]^T$. A camera is modeled by the usual pinhole: the relationship between a 3D point $\X$ and its image projection $\x$ is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pinhole}
  s\,\x = K\, [R ~~ t]\,\X \quad \mbox{with } K =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      f_x & 0   & c_x \\
      0   & f_y & c_y \\
      0   & 0   & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $s$ is an arbitrary scale factor; $(R,t)$ called the extrinsic parameters, is the rotation and translation which relates the world coordinate system to the camera coordinate system; $K$ is called the camera intrinsic matrix, and $(c_x,c_y)$ are the coordinates of the principal point, $f_x$ and $f_y$ are the focal lengths expressed in pixel units.




\subsection{Bundle adjustment}
\label{sec:BA}

Needing to estimate relative poses of several cameras or many poses of a single moving camera is a common problem. It is often solved by jointly estimating the set of camera poses along with 3D features that are detected by some set of cameras. This approach is called bundle adjustment (BA) \cite{BA}.

Bundle adjustment algorithms take the following three data as inputs (see Figure~\ref{fig:BA}):
\begin{itemize*}
 \item a set of $n$ 3D point positions $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$,
 \item $m$ camera parameters $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_m$,
 \item and the positions of the projections $x_{ij}$ (measurements) of the points $Xi$ in the camera $Pj$ where they are visible.
\end{itemize*}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

 \caption{Three points $X_1, X_2, X_3$ are observed by three cameras $P_1, P_2, P_3$.}
 \label{fig:BA}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Bundle adjustment optimize both the scene $X_i$ and camera parameters $P_j$ by minimizing the sum of squared re-projection errors:
\[
 \sum _{i=1}^{n}\sum _{j\in V_{i}}\left( x_{ij}-P_{i}X_{j}\right)^2
\]

\noindent
\textbf{Note:} Ceres Solver has been utilized to solve this optimization problem, see section \ref{sec:ceres} for a short introduction to Ceres and section \ref{sec:ceres_impl} to see the cost function used in the later defined estimation process.


\subsection{Triangulation}
\label{sec:triangulation}

A simple linear triangulation methods is described \cite{HZ2}. Measurement $\x = P \, \X , \mathbf{\tilde{x'}} = P' \, \mathbf{\tilde{X}}$ can be combined to form a linear equation: $A\, \X = 0$. The homogeneous scale factor is eliminated by a cross product $\x = P\,\X$ to give equations that form the following equation system:
\begin{equation}
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
  x \mathbf{p}^{3T} - \mathbf{p}^{1T} \\
  y \mathbf{p}^{3T} - \mathbf{p}^{2T} \\
  x' \mathbf{p}^{3T} - \mathbf{p}^{1T} \\
  y' \mathbf{p}^{3T} - \mathbf{p}^{2T}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{p}^{iT}$ are the rows of P. Then the system $A\, \X = 0$ is solved with SVD\footnote{Singular Value Decomposition} as it is explained in \cite{HZ2}.




\subsubsection{N-View Triangulation}
\label{sec:nview_triangulation}

It is easy to extend this methods for multiple views by adding more rows to the matrix $A$. Implementation in section \ref{sec:triangulation_impl}.
