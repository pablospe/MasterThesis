\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{cha:conclusions}

This project combines the strongest of several \textbf{open-source} components: KDL, Ceres Solves, ROS, OpenCV and PR2 (open-source platform, see Figure \ref{fig:PR2_free_robot}). It cannot be less to contribute in the same way to the community, making the code freely available as a ROS package (even though it is still in development stage).

The above mentioned software components are well designed, with excellent interfaces and documentation. Even though this fact, \textbf{combining} them in an unique product is a \textbf{time consuming} task, which requires different type of abilities; for example, solve compilation problems with CMake or Catkin (new compilation system in ROS), to mention one.

Regarding the thesis itself, \textbf{robot calibration} is an important problem to be solved in any robot, in order to allow an effective interaction with the environment. And this thesis has been focused in \textbf{multiple camera calibration}. The work has been done by experimenting with real data, real robots, real problems.

Two different methods have been proposed for the \textbf{structure initialization} (3D points). Initialization used for the bundle adjustment optimizer (Ceres Solver). These methods are: solvePnP --3D points in the camera reference-- and the n-view triangulation method.

The improvement in calibration has been shown \textbf{visually} --for a human-friendly comparison-- and \textbf{quantitatively} --for a more rigorous analysis--. A bias has been observed in the solvePnP solution, which will lead to further investigations using the triangulation method, with the intention of improve the results even more.


To conclude with this thesis, it has been a \textbf{proud} to work with two excellent person like David Fofi and Vincent Rabaud, in two excellent places like Le2i and Willow Garage.
