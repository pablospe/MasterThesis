\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

In robotics, sensor calibration is extremely important since a robot
becomes less useful without a proper calibration. Examples: % where calibration is necessary are:
\begin{itemize*}
 \item \textbf{Manipulation}: while grasping or interacting with the environment using its arms, detecting a object is a common task, and an uncalibrated robot will mis-grasp it leading a failure,

 \item \textbf{Sensor fusion}: suppose 3D data from a sensor and it is desired to overlay this information with color images in order to create a 3D model. This is difficult to do if the sensor are not well calibrated.
\end{itemize*}


In this thesis multiple camera calibration will be addressed. The term \textit{recalibration} refers to that an initial calibration is provided from the robot model.


\section{Thesis organization} % and methodology}

The background is presented in chapter \ref{cha:background}, and it is divided in two main sections: first, a \textbf{theoretical background} will be explained in section~\ref{sec:theoretical_background}; second, a \textbf{technical background} in section~\ref{cha:technical_background}, where ROS \cite{ROS}, RViz (ROS visualizer) \cite{RViz}, PR2 (Personal Robot 2, from Willow Garage) \cite{PR2}, KDL (Kinematics and Dynamics Library) \cite{KDL}, Ceres Solver (non-linear least squares minimizer) \cite{ceres}, and other infinity amount of tools will be briefly explained.

Chapter~\ref{cha:multi-view calibration} explain the process and methods developed is this thesis. \textbf{Real data} from PR2 is used to calibrate the cameras and results are presented.

Posteriorly, implementation details (chapter~\ref{cha:implementation}), future work (chapter~\ref{cha:future}) and conclusion (chapter~\ref{cha:conclusions}) are also discussed.

% Another strong division in this thesis is the use of \textbf{synthetic data} (chapter~\ref{cha:stereo_recalibration}) vs \textbf{real data} (chapter~\ref{cha:multi-view calibration}). Synthetic data has been used in stereo in order to \textbf{validate} the method (posteriorly generalized for more cameras), before endeavor a more complicated task with real data.




\section{Goal}

The thesis goal is to create a ROS calibration package for multiple cameras calibration, such as RGB cameras, Microsoft Kinect, Prosilicas, and other cameras mounted in a robot; our test case, mounted in the PR2 head.




% This cameras It possible to calibrate cameras that are connected by moving joints.



\section{Related Work}

Many people have developed specific techniques for pairwise calibration between

sensors. In \cite{Zhang04extrinsiccalibration}, line constraints are used to calibrate a 2D laser range-finder to a camera. Similar work was done in \cite{Unnikrishnan_fastextrinsic}, but focused on using plane constraints from a 3D laser range-finder system. A more complex case is when an actuated camera system needs to be calibrated (hand-in-eye system) and has been address by Horaud \cite{Horaud_hand-eyecalibration}. Other articles like \cite{Dynamic_camera_calibration} and \cite{4587681} were particularly useful to understand fundamental concepts. In addition, the PR2 calibration package is described in \cite{pr2_calibration_paper}.
