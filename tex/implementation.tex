\chapter{Some implementation details}
\label{cha:implementation}

Software engineering decisions, problems, solutions?, and resignations... :P


----

Why re-implement the calibration estimation package?

Why re-implement the robot\_state\_publisher? Explain the how to Publish the /tf tree?
Why KDL? KDL structures are not modificable, so it was needed to re-create KDL once the urdf is updated.

RViz and Markers! Republish everytime!
